# Driving School Database Project

Welcome to my Driving School Database project! This comprehensive project is built using Heidi SQL and includes a PowerPoint presentation and Word documentation for clear understanding.

## Project Components

### Database Structure
- The heart of the project is the relational database in Heidi SQL.
- It captures essential data entities, including cars, instructors, students, courses, classes, and tests.

### Data Relationships
